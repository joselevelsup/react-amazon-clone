## React Amazon Clone

Initially this project is to rebuild Amazon's listing inventory using Express, React, MongoDB, and ES6 Javascript. 


Currently setup:
- Webpack Dev Server
- Compiling SASS to a bundled CSS file
- Compiling React ES6 to a bundled JS file
- Server to show the app when building
- Dev server with Hot Reloading
- Finish my changes
- Push my commits to GitHub
- Open a pull request

Todo: 
- Style it up with Bootstrap and custom components
- Make API endpoints on the server
- Seperate Webpack to a Config, Dev, and Prod file
- Include React Redux and API calls to server
- Build for Production
